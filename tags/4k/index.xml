Earlier in 2021, NuSan mentioned the Kuwahara filter in a discord server I'm in. The filter was originally invented to reduce noise in photos without making them look blurry, but it has the pleasant side effect of making images look a bit like paintings if the filter is applied with a sufficiently large kernel size.
I started by making a simple tree in a fragment shader.</description></item><item><title>Watchtower</title><link>https://slerpy.xyz/posts/watchtower/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slerpy.xyz/posts/watchtower/</guid><description>a 4k exe-gfx released at Névoke 2021

This entry has been strongly inspired by the artist Windmill and especially their texture generator called JsPlacement.
Though, because of size limitations I was not able to embed a texture into the executable, so I made a very minimal copy of the tool using fragment shaders.
From here it was a matter of using the generated texture to create an interesting-looking scene. I used the texture as a heightmap for the floor, as a color map for the blue pattern over the geometry, and as displacement on the tower.</description></item><item><title>Off by One</title><link>https://slerpy.xyz/posts/off-by-one/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slerpy.xyz/posts/off-by-one/</guid><description>a 4k exe-gfx released at Outline 2021

This entry started as a shower thought two days before the deadline: What if I wrote a path tracer but instead of starting the ray at the camera, I start tracing from the light source and put a point on the screen where the ray ends up?
This turned out to be fairly easy to implement in vertex shaders since they allow you to put points on the screen at given coordinates and also let you compute a lot of rays at once.</description></item><item><title>Convergence</title><link>https://slerpy.xyz/posts/convergence/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slerpy.xyz/posts/convergence/</guid><description>a 4k exe-gfx entry released at NOVA 2020

This was my first proper exe-gfx entry. Up until this point, all of my entries have been real-time, meaning I always had to be careful with using system resources to ensure the entry runs at 60 fps in 1080p. So I decided I wanted to do something with tons of lines, rendered across multiple frames because I could.
The system I came up with initially would use one framebuffer to store the start and end position for millions of lines in the XY and ZW components of each pixel respectively, and a second shader would go through and render these onto the screen.</description></item><item><title>Wackelkontakt</title><link>https://slerpy.xyz/posts/wackelkontakt/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slerpy.xyz/posts/wackelkontakt/</guid><description>a 4k PC intro released at Revision 2020

First of all, I want to thank noby for their amazing work with the intro. Not only are they responsible for the entire soundtrack and gave the visuals a final touch, but they also provided the 4k intro framework Leviathan-2.0, which this intro is based on.
As a disclaimer, this write-up will be written from my perspective, and I will hence not spend too much time talking about the music or how the framework as linked above works.</description></item><item><title>sler.py</title><link>https://slerpy.xyz/posts/sler-py/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slerpy.xyz/posts/sler-py/</guid><description>The following exchange took place on March 18, 2019 in a conversation about domain hacks on discord:
slerpy I just realized if I do that with my handle, it looks a python script yx :D yx write a demo in python yx I want to see the beamslide for sler.py by slerpy
Yeah, so that's how that happened.
The Entry This is the 4k exe-gfx entry sler.py by slerpy, which renders a picture of slerpy.</description></item><item><title>Think Outside the Box</title><link>https://slerpy.xyz/posts/think-outside-the-box/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slerpy.xyz/posts/think-outside-the-box/</guid><description>a 4k PC intro released at Under Construction 2018

In this intro, I wanted to play around with real-time graphics using baked, path-traced lighting. I am aware that baked lighting is quite popular in oldschool demos, but as far as I know, this is the first 4k PC intro to implement it.
The Lightmap The lighting information for all four rooms is stored in one flat texture, that is rendered at the start of the intro.</description></item></channel></rss>
