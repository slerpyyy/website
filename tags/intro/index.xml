This intro is a demonstration of a way to simulate buffer swaps using special color values, all within 256 bytes.
The naive way to render an effect like this would be to first clear the entire screen, then draw some lines and repeat. This works in theory but it creates a lot of flickering since you're very likely to see the image while it's in the middle of either clearing or rendering, meaning the lines are only partially visible.</description></item><item><title>Think Outside the Box</title><link>https://slerpy.xyz/posts/think-outside-the-box/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slerpy.xyz/posts/think-outside-the-box/</guid><description>a 4k PC intro released at Under Construction 2018

In this intro, I wanted to play around with real-time graphics using baked, path-traced lighting. I am aware that baked lighting is quite popular in oldschool demos, but as far as I know, this is the first 4k PC intro to implement it.
The Lightmap The lighting information for all four rooms is stored in one flat texture, that is rendered at the start of the intro.</description></item></channel></rss>
