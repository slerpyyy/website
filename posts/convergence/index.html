This was my first proper exe-gfx entry. Up until this point, all of my entries have been real-time, meaning I always had to be careful with using system resources to ensure the entry runs at 60 fps in 1080p. So I decided I wanted to do something with tons of lines, rendered across multiple frames because I could.
The system I came up with initially would use one framebuffer to store the start and end position for millions of lines in the XY and ZW components of each pixel respectively, and a second shader would go through and render these onto the screen."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://slerpy.xyz/posts/convergence/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.7cea68b77c83e5da57c9a11c56919d4de2e6847751854f818c1d6aeb21f21f85.css integrity="sha256-fOpot3yD5dpXyaEcVpGdTeLmhHdRhU+BjB1q6yHyH4U=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><script defer crossorigin=anonymous src=/assets/js/highlight.f413e19d0714851f6474e7ee9632408e58ac146fbdbe62747134bea2fa3415e0.js integrity="sha256-9BPhnQcUhR9kdOfuljJAjlisFG+9vmJ0cTS+ovo0FeA=" onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
