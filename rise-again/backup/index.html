                <h3 class="text-center mt-0">Triangle Ring</h3>
                <p class="my-3">
                    This is by far the most prominent light source in the render. The triangle ring is an additional
                    solid I implemented on top of the regular triangle. It uses barycentric coordinates to compute the
                    distance between the hit point and the outer edge of the triangle. If that distance is greater
                    than a given thickness parameter, the intersection is ignored.
                    <br class="mb-3">
                    The solid also implements the area and sample functions needed to use it as an area light.
                    I used two of these triangle rings with opposite orientations stacked on top of each other to
                    allow the ring to cast light both upwards and downwards. To prevent intersections with the wrong
                    solid, the triangle ring is completely invisible from one side.
                    <br class="mb-3">
                    By far the biggest challenge with the triangle ring was getting the part of the statue, which is
                    on the same plane as the triangle to converge reasonably well. Because of the steep angle to the
                    area light, most light samples from this "belt region" are either dark or occluded. Only very few
                    samples actually contribute to the final color, which leads to extremely slow conversion. To fix
                    this, the surface normal returned by the sample function is slightly randomly perturbed, which
                    effectively blurs away the problematic region. To get rid of any remaining artifacts, a simple
                    star shaped median filter is applied to the image, once the render is complete.

                <h3 class="text-center mt-5">God Rays</h3>
                <p class="my-3">
                    The renderer implements a simplified version of volumetric rendering to give more focus the spot
                    light in the center of the scene. This was done by implementing a new "Holy Recursive Ray
                    Tracing Integrator" which extends an integrator from a pervious assignment by an additional
                    volumetric pass.
                    <br class="mb-3">
                    This pass works by intersecting a ray with the scene, then walking along the ray and checking for
                    visibility with the spotlight in each step. The samples checked along the ray are at equal distance
                    to each other, but offset by a random amount each time. Averaging over these samples gives
                    us an approximation of how much light is being scattered towards the camera.
                    <br class="mb-3">
                    In order to make the spotlight a little bit more natural, I implemented a new "Area Spotlight",
                    which randomizes it's position within a rectangular region. This helps to feather out the outer
                    edge of the cone, in which the spotlight functions.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-center mt-5">Tesselation</h3>
                <p class="my-3">
                    To make use of the "SmoothTriangle" class I implemented for a previous assignment, I added a
                    "tessel" function, which takes the triangles created by the "loadOBJ" function as input and
                    generates smooth triangles that represent the same geometry.
                    <br class="mb-3">
                    The function first iterates over the list of triangles and collects all vertices in the geometry
                    as well as the normals of the triangles, which are connected to those vertices. In a second pass,
                    the flat triangles are swapped out for smooth triangles, if the angle between the vertex normals
                    is small enough. If two of the vertex normals point too far away from each other, interpolating
                    between those normals may result in a zero vector. In this case, the triangle is not replaced.

                <h3 class="text-center mt-5">Bloom Pass</h3>
                <p class="my-3">
                    The bloom effect is a tool to make the highlights of the scene stand out even more. Something like
                    this happens with real cameras when parts of an image are overexposed and the brightness bleeds
                    onto the surrounding pixels. This effect is applied after the ray tracer finished rendering the
                    image in it's entirety and before color correction is applied. In software this effect can be
                    implemented efficiently using an iterative algorithm:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Make a copy of the image produced by the ray tracer</li>
                        <li>Lower the blacks to ensure only the highlights of the image contribute to the bloom effect</li>
                        <li>Downscale the copied image by a factor of 2</li>
                        <li>Blur the copied image</li>
                        <li>Add the blurred image back to the original image</li>
                        <li>Go back to step 3 and repeat a couple of times</li>
                    </ol>
                    Since the image we need to blur in each iteration quarters in size every time, this algorithm
                    is extremely fast, making it suitable even for real-time applications.

                <h3 class="text-center mt-0">Post Processing</h3>
                <p class="my-3">
                    The post processing pass is the last alteration of the image before it is written into the final
                    png file. Its main propose is color correction, but some color grading is also applied. This pass
                    consists of many small operations which are applied to each pixel in the image. I'm going to
                    summarize these steps briefly here:
                    <ul>
                        <li>First the <b>reinhardt operator</b> is used to map the value of each color from [0, &infin;) down to [0, 1)</li>
                        <li>Then <b>brightness</b> and <b>saturation</b> are raised back up a little bit</li>
                        <li>A <b>smoothstep</b> curve is used to add more contrast to the image</li>
                        <li>Now <b>gamma correction</b> is applied</li>
                        <li>A bit of <b>film grain</b> is added to reduce color banding</li>
                    </ul>

                <p class="mb-3">
                    A big part of the inspiration for this entry comes from two very different sources.
                    I got the idea for the general motive and composition of this piece from the cover art of the
                    album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_(Perfume_album)">Triangle</a> by Perfume.
                    The lighting was mainly inspired by this scene in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=43&v=QhqT0DhV9yE">Dope on Wax</a>,
                    a 64k PC intro made by Logicoma, which was released at the Revision Demoparty in 2019.
                    <br class="mb-3">
                    The statue in the middle of the scene is an open-source model provided by Stanford University for
                    students to use for free. The model is called "Lucy" and can be found on this GitHub repository labeled
                    <a href="https://github.com/alecjacobson/common-3d-test-models">"common-3d-test-models"</a>. All
                    other 3D geometry is generated procedurally.
                    The picture of Bernie Sanders sitting in the cold has been taken from <a href="https://p.dw.com/p/3oMNU">this article</a>
                    which credits "Brendan Smialowski/AFP" for the photo. In case you don't know what I'm talking about,
                    you might want to take another look at my render.
